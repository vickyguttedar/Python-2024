- This can help in better matching referees with games.

## **4. Notifications and Reminders**

- Implement a notification system to remind referees of their upcoming assignments.
- Notify game organizers of any changes in assignments or feedback submissions.

## **5. Performance Analytics**

- Track referee performance over time using metrics such as feedback scores, number of games officiated, etc.
- Generate reports or dashboards for administrators to analyze referee performance.

## **6. Conflict Resolution**

- Develop a method to handle conflicts in scheduling, such as double bookings or last-minute cancellations.
- Allow referees to indicate preferences for certain games or time slots.

## **7. Feedback Analytics**

- Provide analytics on feedback collected, such as average scores per referee or common areas for improvement.
- Allow referees to respond to feedback and track their improvement over time.

## **8. Game History Tracking**

- Maintain a history of games officiated by each referee, including details like scores, teams involved, and feedback received.
